SIMCACHE
=====

A python-based library for keeping track
of CMB simulations and filtered skymaps.

Requirements:
 * numpy
 * healpy
 * qcinv

Is known to work with:
 * python 2.6.1
 * numpy 1.5.0

There were some bugs with spin-s transforms
in healpy, fixed in the github-devel version
with commit af19f95fd3c72bfda35fdf9076728d07 

To install:

python setup.py install

(or add the simcache directory to your $PYTHONPATH)

The simcache maintains a "data" directory to
which it may download files. By default the
data directory will be at the root of the
installation, although you can select a 
different directory by setting the environment
variable $SIMCACHE_DATA

To test:

There are some sample scripts which will
generate WMAP temperature (and polarization)
simulations, filter them and then plot their
spectra in the examples/wmap directory, e.g.

cd examples/wmap
./plot_cl_t_ivf.py
